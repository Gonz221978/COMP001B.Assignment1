Purpose: I will build a basic two-page website with an external stylesheet and demonstrate my ability to use CSS type, class, and id selectors. I will make changes to my repository using the git command-line tool throughout the process. Finally, I will validate my HTML and CSS code.

This repository contains a simple personal website built as part of a CSS course project. It consists of:
- `index.html`: The homepage that introduces what I hope to learn in the course.
- `about.html`: A page where I share a bit about myself.
- `main.css`: An external stylesheet that ensures consistent styling across all pages.
